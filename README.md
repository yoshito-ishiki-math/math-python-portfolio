# math-python-portfolio
A collection of math-related programming challenges solved with Python.
# Math × Python Portfolio

This repository contains solutions to math-related programming challenges, mainly from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in Python.

The purpose of this project is to explore mathematical thinking through code, and to practice solving problems using clean and efficient algorithms.

## Contents

- Solutions to Project Euler problems (so far: #1–#17, #20, #25, #29, #35, #40, #48, #97, #120)
- Focus on number theory, combinatorics, and efficient computation
- Code written in Python 3

## Motivation

I come from a mathematical research background, and I started this portfolio during a difficult time in my life.  
Working through these problems gave me a sense of focus and calm.  
This repository reflects my personal journey of learning, recovery, and curiosity.

## How to use

Each problem is saved as a separate file:  
`problem_1.py`, `problem_2.py`, ...

You can run them directly with Python 3.
